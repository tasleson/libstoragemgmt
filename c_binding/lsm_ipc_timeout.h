/* How long (seconds) a client has to complete plugin_register before the
 * plug-in gives up on it. The plug-in runners turn this into a single
 * absolute deadline covering every read and write until registration, so a
 * peer cannot renew it by sending requests, nor stall us by refusing to read
 * our replies. The daemon uses the same value for the defense-in-depth
 * SO_RCVTIMEO/SO_SNDTIMEO it sets before fork(). Kept consistent with
 * REGISTRATION_TIMEOUT in python_binding/lsm/_pluginrunner.py. Cleared once
 * the client registers, so slow post-registration operations are never
 * interrupted. */
